  * Using Windows, Mac or Linux systems
  * Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and other databases supported by the luasql library
  * MVC structure
  * Parsing of Lua pages
  * Routing
  * Basic Object-relational mapping
  * Validation

  * Easy deployment (unix only) -> sailor create "app name" /dir/to/app
  * Form generation
  * Lua at client (possible through a Lua=>JS virtual machine deployed with the app)
  * Friendly urls
  * Inspect function for better debugging => similar to a var dump
  * Custom 404 pages

### Roadmap
* Integration with mod_lua's DB API and DB module refactor
* Improvements to the form and validation module

More about the motivation to build this project can be found here: http://etiene.net/10/sailor

### Directory tree info
* /docs - this one is supposed to have documentation
* /lua-to-js-vms - different Lua->Javascript virtual machines for use of Lua in the browser with Sailor
* /rockspecs - Rockspec files for LuaRocks install
* /src - Lua modules with nice stuff from Sailor and other places.
 * /sailor - Sailor modules
 * /sailor/blank-app - blank Sailor web app, can be copy-pasted as base for your own apps
* /test - apps for testing and demonstration purposes

### Supported Environments

Sailor has been tested under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and is currently compatible with Apache with [mod_lua](http://www.modlua.org/) or [mod_pLua](https://github.com/Humbedooh/mod_pLua), Nginx with [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module), [Lwan](http://lwan.ws/), Lighttpd with [mod_magnet](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs_ModMagnet), or any CGI-enabled web server, like [Civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb), [Mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose) and [Xavante](http://keplerproject.github.io/xavante/), if [CGILua](https://github.com/keplerproject/cgilua) is present.

### Installation

For Linux, see [INSTALL_LINUX.md](https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_LINUX.md) (Ubuntu) or [INSTALL_LINUX_ARCH.md](https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_LINUX_ARCH.md) (Arch Linux)

For Windows, see [INSTALL_WIN.md](https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_WIN.md)

For Mac, see [INSTALL_MAC.md](https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_MAC.md)

### Using Sailor
A default Sailor app will have the following directory tree structure:
* /conf - configuration files, open and edit them.
* /controllers - controllers you will make!
* /themes - default theme files.
* /models - models you will make!
* /pub - publicly accessible files (js libraries, for example)
* /runtime - temporary files generated during runtime.
* /tests - unit and functional tests
* /views - this is where your lua pages in .lp will go

#### Creating Pages #
Go to /controllers and create your first controller! It should be a lua module. Name it whatever you want, our example is "site.lua". We will serve two pages, one accessible via <domain>/?r=site which will run site.index() by default and another one acessible via <domain>/?r=site/notindex.
```lua
local site = {}
local model = require "sailor.model"
function site.index(page)
  local foo = 'Hello world'
  local User = model("user")
  local u = User:new()
  u.username = "etiene"
  u.password = "a_password"
  local valid, err = u:validate() -- validate() will check if your attributes follow the rules!
  if not valid then
    foo = "Boohoo :("
  end

  -- Warning: this is a tech preview and some methods of model class do not avoid SQL injections yet.
  page:render('index',{foo=foo,name=u.username}) -- This will render /views/site/index.lp and pass the variables 'foo' and 'name'
end
function site.notindex(page)
  page:write('<b>Hey you!</b>')
end
return site
```
Go to /views, create a dir named 'site' to match your controller name and create your first page, our example is index.lp

```html
<?=foo?>
<p>
  Hi, <?=name?>
</p>
```
For more information on what you can do with html and Lua Pages, visit http://keplerproject.github.io/cgilua/manual.html#templates

For more examples, you can check the test controller (/controllers/test.lua), the test views (/views/test/*) and the User model (/models/user.lua)
